    Duggan likes to tag along with the Ok.rb group whenever he can and tries to squeeze as much info out of the members so one day he can graduate from an apprentice to a black belt Rubyist. You can follow Duggan on <a href="http://twitter.com/kingduggan">twitter</a> or locate him on <a href="http://github.com/kingduggan1">github</a>.
